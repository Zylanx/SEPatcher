# SEPatcher
A Patcher and Mod Loader for the game Stationeers

# Project Structure
SEPatcher - This project contains the library that does all the assembly patching  
SEPatcherConsole - This project contains a _very_ basic command-line frontend that will be changed and replaced with a GUI in future  
SEModLoader - This project contains the actual Mod Loader DLL file  
HelmetLockMod - This is a very simple mod that adds a "Lock Helmet" keybind to the controls menu, that when pushed, toggles the mask lock state  

# Warning
This is currently very WIP and is effectively just quick prototype
The code is uncommented currently as it will soon be completely rewritten to have a much improved interface and API.
The Mod Loader will also become more of a Mod Manager and Mod API with Loader, to make things easier

In other words, this is just for fun. Don't be too mean about it
